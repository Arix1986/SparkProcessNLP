Even GeForce cannot use it."
1,"at a college event where I was invited as a guest, a student asked during the Q&A what did I think about the new Nvidia GeForce GPU's potential impact on RPG games. His smirk & his two friends next to him elbowing him told me what this was about. ""I don't know,"" I said. He sat down giggling, smirk intact. I guess, a lot of what I'd been talking about in the Q&A was related to games due to my past experience & present pursuits. And I know how self-proclaimed ""hardcore gamers"" get when people who have worked in mobile or casual gaming talk about gaming. 

A faculty member later apologised for his immature behaviour. I told him - I have worked in male-dominated spaces all my life, it's fine. My problem wasn't his question, it was the lack of sincerity. 

I've worked alongside some really top tier talent thanks to my career, and in quite exciting/glam spaces that too, what with Netflix and EA. The one trait absolutely nobody who is worth their salt ever demonstrates is cockiness. Not coz they aren't cocky (everyone's a little cocky about their strengths/passions deep down), but 'coz cockiness gets you nowhere in life. Like it or not, you need people to succeed, no matter how much you know. 

The truly smart ones know this, and therefore use every opportunity with anyone who has done anything remotely useful in life to extract from them whatever knowledge, insights, experience they possess. Whether or not you like or use it is up to you.

So yeah, if you find it useful to ask a person who has done product management in mobile gaming about gaming hardware, then go for it. But it might speak more to your stupidity than theirs. The era of the brilliant jerk is passé, non-brilliant jerks certainly don't stand a chance."

**Case Lighting:** 360-degree RGB ""Intimidation Glow"" – Shifts colors based on your in-game performance, turning blood-red when you’re on a 20-kill streak.

**Audio:** Bose ""Mic Drop"" Sound System – Blasts taunts and victory cries at 120 decibels, with bass so deep it rattles your opponent’s setup across the internet.

**Special Feature:** Built-in ""Championship Confidence Chip"" – Automatically adjusts your aim, reflexes, and trash-talking skills to hot shot levels, but only if you’re wearing aviators and a mullet wig while gaming.

AI is transforming the way we work, create, and play. At AMGI, we are bringing that power to entertainment.

The Future of AI Entertainment with NVIDIA

At AMGI Studios, we’re harnessing the same cutting-edge AI technology to revolutionize how animation and gaming are created. From AI powered animated characters to real-time game interactions in My Pet Hooligan, our partnership with NVIDIA is helping bring AI to life in ways never imagined before.

We are revolutionizing AI driven entertainment with our Chatbuddy technology and AMGI LLM, a powerful AI architecture designed to deliver personalized, engaging character interactions. 

Integrated into My Pet Hooligan, our LLM Server allows seamless switching between top tier AI models like ChatGPT, Llama 3.2, and our proprietary AMGI LLM balancing cost, performance, and response quality. This system enables advanced query routing, real-time memory retention, and multimodal capabilities, including text, image, and speech-based interactions. 

With dynamic character animations, web integrated knowledge retrieval, and custom AI voices, Chatbuddy brings characters to life in a way never seen before, making AI entertainment more immersive, responsive, and adaptable.

Our AI driven infrastructure ensures security, scalability, and efficiency, with innovations like chat summarization, local LLM execution for privacy and speed, and vision models for real-time emotional expression capture. By pioneering serverless architecture and AI powered animations, we are setting a new standard for AI in gaming, animation, and interactive entertainment.

“Alright, are we sure we want to do this whole Nvidia panic thing again? Stock’s down 8% post-earnings—because why? Tariffs? Softness in China? Here’s the deal: this is exactly why I hate earnings season. It’s just people firing off these ridiculous hot takes, praying they get picked up by some aggregator because apparently the short-term narrative matters way more than anything real. Can we at least agree that’s annoying? And look, I’m not anti-paying attention to earnings, but when you start pretending Nvidia isn’t absolutely torching the AI market right now, I just—I don’t know, man. Also, can we talk about Jensen Huang’s leather jacket for a second? Have you seen that thing? Leather jackets are impossible to pull off—I’ve tried, believe me, I’ve tried, and every single time I end up looking like a guy who panicked last-minute before a Tinder date. I can’t pull it off. I wish I could, I really do. But Jensen strolls up in the leather jacket, absolutely dominating a room, with like 300 direct reports behind him—and nobody even blinks. And we’re worried about a couple months of softness in China? Seriously? Let’s not pretend Jensen’s jacket doesn’t matter more than some quarterly guidance. Everybody relax. Jensen’s jacket is fine. Nvidia’s fine. We’re all gonna be fine.”"

1,"Good morning, and God bless, #Team42!

Today’s Key Macro Question(s): Will #DOGE achieve significant deficit reduction?

No. But before we unpack why, we must quickly discuss NVIDIA’s $NVDA results. Fiscal Q4 sales beat by the smallest margin since Feb-23 and earnings beat by the smallest margin since Nov-22. CEO Jensen Huang guided to quarterly sales of ~$43bn—which beat analysts’ estimates, but also signaled lower gross margins due to the rollout of their new Blackwell chips. $NVDA stock is up +1% in the premarket today.

A lot of paper hands puked their #Bitcoin this week in anticipation of an $NVDA crash, among other things. Congrats to you if you weren’t one of them.

Back to #DOGE, we continue to believe that D.C. and Mar-a-Lago’s addiction to debt-financed growth will prevent @elonmusk from achieving his goal of significant deficit reduction. We took a lot of heat from poorly informed members of the Elon Musk fan club when we initially balked at the original $2tn dollar goal back in December with our friend @LukeGromen (replay: https://t.co/qrlVanZY0C). Emphasis on “poorly informed”. Some people don’t know what they don’t know and social media makes it easy as ever for them to prove how uninformed they are to the world.

We went on record saying @DOGE would likely find $500bn-$1tn in expenditure reductions, and that those cuts would be more than offset by: 1) the per annum double-digit growth of politically protected categories like Social Security, Medicare, and, now, Medicaid; 2) the $100bn-plus annual growth of net interest as Treasury debt matures and refinanced into a higher interest rate regime; and 3) the multi-trillion dollar cost of extending and expanding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) aka “Trump Tax Cuts”.

That was back in early December—well over a month before the DOGE effort officially commenced. What have we learned since?

1. @elonmusk confirmed Monday that DOGE has found $65bn of cost cuts thus far, which is well south of the ~$143bn currently being reported by https://t.co/Xv1WSQtpTW… like everything in politics, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle;
2. The House passed a budget resolution authorizing $2tn of spending cuts and $4.5 trillion of tax cuts, which result in an additional $2.5tn of fiscal deficits over the next 10yrs relative to the baseline of current law;
3. The Senate passed a much smaller budget that codifies their two-step approach to reconciliation: border and energy policy first, extending and expanding the Trump tax cuts second;
4. @realDonaldTrump posted yesterday morning, “I hope the House and Senate are able to agree on making the Tax cuts PERMANENT!”;
5. Understanding that this was the goal all along, the Senate is pursuing a budgetary accounting method called “current policy”, which magically reduces the cost of extending the TCJA—the main provisions of which expire on December 31—to $0, freeing up funds to expand the program to include President Trump’s campaign promises like “no tax on tips or overtime pay” and lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from the current 21%, among other things;
6. The House is currently pursuing a budgetary accounting method called “current law”—which correctly assumes the TCJA expires on December 31—to appease fiscal hawks that do not want this process to be treated like a blank check for more tax cuts that aren’t offset by expenditure reductions. Per Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a House Freedom Caucus member: “If you’re gonna do the policy baseline and make the TCJA permanent, if you’re gonna have more tax cuts but then you’re gonna presumably lower spending restraint, which is where some people are gonna wanna go, it just doesn’t add up.”
7. While the difference in budgetary accounting methods won’t make a difference to the amount of additional public debt in isolation, we can assume that if the Senate wins this debate, there will be incremental Treasury supply on top of the additional $2.5tn of public debt House Republicans voted for Tuesday evening.

We continue to believe the US is heading for a fiscal crisis by ~2030 due to a variety of factors, including:

1. Unserious efforts to eliminate deficits and stabilize debt growth (e.g., “we’re going to grow our way out of it”… HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, LOL);
2. A glaring unwillingness by Congress to present the American people with tough choices that require meaningful sacrifice;
3. The fact that risk-adjusted-return-seeking private sector investors—who are not dumb enough to fall for Congressional accounting gimmickry—now own 56% of the marketable Treasury market, up from 36% in late-2021;
4. The changing geopolitical landscape that may further reduce international demand for Treasury securities; and
5. The likelihood that the crisis phase of the current Fourth Turning catalyzes a complete mobilization of public sector resources and exponential growth in public sector debt to finance it.

All told, while the Treasury bond market may get temporarily bailed out by a deepening US growth scare, investors would be remiss to overstay their welcome. #Gold has experienced a largely uninterrupted bull run since fall 2023 due to the aforementioned reasons. Congrats to @42Macro clients for all the money they’ve made by staying on the right side of bullion market risk.

As one of the faces of the #AmericanDream across global Wall Street, I love my country and hope that our elected and unelected officials get this right. 

The #FourthTurning debt clock is ticking…

His smirk & his two friends next to him elbowing him told me what this was about. ""I don't know,"" I said. He sat down giggling, smirk intact. I guess, a lot of what I'd been talking about in the Q&A was related to games due to my past experience & present pursuits. And I know how self-proclaimed ""hardcore gamers"" get when people who have worked in mobile or casual gaming talk about gaming. 

A faculty member later apologised for his immature behaviour. I told him - I have worked in male-dominated spaces all my life, it's fine. My problem wasn't his question, it was the lack of sincerity. 

I've worked alongside some really top tier talent thanks to my career, and in quite exciting/glam spaces that too, what with Netflix and EA. The one trait absolutely nobody who is worth their salt ever demonstrates is cockiness. Not coz they aren't cocky (everyone's a little cocky about their strengths/passions deep down), but 'coz cockiness gets you nowhere in life. Like it or not, you need people to succeed, no matter how much you know. 

The truly smart ones know this, and therefore use every opportunity with anyone who has done anything remotely useful in life to extract from them whatever knowledge, insights, experience they possess. Whether or not you like or use it is up to you.

This guy has access to one of the largest compute clusters and is already out of compute. 

And some people still think NVIDIA is running out of demand soon. ‍

As Jensen said, compute demand is going through the roof and DeepSeek-like efficiency increases super charge demand since it rapidly improves the economics of AI services and unlocks vastly smarter AI systems at an affordable price. 

For example, a deepsearch can easily consume 100x or a 1000x the compute of a one-shot inferencing run and can have run times of several minutes. 

The next step will be ultra deep search where models may ponder for days offer scientific problems and run large scale simulations on their own to generate novel solutions to problems.

1,"A few initial thoughts on $NVDA's report:

1) The GPU demand/Blackwell ramp story looks fine. FQ1 sales guide of $43B is in-line with buyside expectations, and they did $11B in FQ4 Blackwell sales (they previously suggested they'd do more than ""several billion"").

2) Related: Purchase commitments for inventory and manufacturing capacity (much of it going to $TSM) were up by $1.9B Q/Q and $14.7B Y/Y to $30.8B, and other non-inventory purchase obligations (much of them tied to cloud commitments) were up by $1.1B Q/Q and $8.7B Y/Y to $13.3B. A good sign they've still got all the server GPU demand they can handle.

3) Networking was a soft spot, dropping 3% Q/Q and 9% Y/Y to $3B (they previously guided for Q/Q growth), following a 15% Q/Q drop in FQ3. Nvidia saying it's ""transitioning from small NVLink 8 with Infiniband to large NVLink 72 with Spectrum X"" seems like a tacit admission that Ethernet is gaining share (positive read-through for $AVGO, $ANET and $CLS).

4) The FQ1 GM guide was a bit light (71% vs. a 72.1% consensus and 73.5% in FQ4). Blackwell ramping fast and TSMC's price hikes probably have a lot to do with this. Curious to hear what they say on the call about how they see GMs trending the rest of this year."

“Alright, are we sure we want to do this whole Nvidia panic thing again? Stock’s down 8% post-earnings—because why? Tariffs? Softness in China? Here’s the deal: this is exactly why I hate earnings season. It’s just people firing off these ridiculous hot takes, praying they get picked up by some aggregator because apparently the short-term narrative matters way more than anything real. Can we at least agree that’s annoying? And look, I’m not anti-paying attention to earnings, but when you start pretending Nvidia isn’t absolutely torching the AI market right now, I just—I don’t know, man. Also, can we talk about Jensen Huang’s leather jacket for a second? Have you seen that thing? Leather jackets are impossible to pull off—I’ve tried, believe me, I’ve tried, and every single time I end up looking like a guy who panicked last-minute before a Tinder date. I can’t pull it off. I wish I could, I really do. But Jensen strolls up in the leather jacket, absolutely dominating a room, with like 300 direct reports behind him—and nobody even blinks. And we’re worried about a couple months of softness in China? Seriously? Let’s not pretend Jensen’s jacket doesn’t matter more than some quarterly guidance. Everybody relax. Jensen’s jacket is fine. Nvidia’s fine. We’re all gonna be fine.”"

Huawei Achieves Key Breakthrough in AI Chip Production, Strengthens Challenge to Nvidia

Huawei has made significant strides in the production of advanced AI chips, with its latest Ascend 910C processors achieving a 40% yield, up from 20% a year ago. This improvement marks a key breakthrough for Huawei and aligns with China's broader goal to develop independent semiconductor production. The enhanced yield has made Huawei's production line for Ascend chips profitable, and the company plans to further improve yields to 60%, matching industry standards. This progress is vital for China’s growing AI industry, despite ongoing US export controls targeting Chinese technology development.
Huawei’s efforts are bolstered by state support, with Beijing encouraging local tech firms to shift from Nvidia’s dominant chips to Huawei’s AI products. However, Huawei still faces challenges, including convincing customers to abandon Nvidia’s superior Cuda software and overcoming limitations in its Ascend 910B chips, such as inter-chip connectivity and memory issues. Despite these hurdles, Huawei is positioning itself as a strong competitor in the ""inference"" chip market, used for running AI models after training. The company is focused on improving its technology to address these challenges and make the Ascend 910C more competitive.
In terms of production, Huawei plans to produce 100,000 Ascend 910C processors and 300,000 910B chips this year. While these numbers suggest Huawei will remain behind Nvidia in sales, especially since Nvidia’s H20 chip is limited by export controls, Huawei still dominates China’s AI chip market, producing more than 75% of AI chips in the country. However, smaller competitors have struggled to secure sufficient production capacity at SMIC, which manufactures the Ascend chips.

1,"Messari expects the DePIN sector to grow to $3.5 Tril by 2028.

One of my top bets for DePIN? $RENDER

And based on what we've seen, Render's been leading both big names in Web2 & Web3 into their decentralized GPU network.

Here's a look at what price RENDER would be at depending on the percentage of market share they can take from the DePIN sector

Reminder that none of this is any financial advice.

There's never any guarantees with investing in crypto

But there are calculated bets and risk minimization, and based on all Render & OTOY's done and the backing for what they're doing...

I'd say RENDER's a pretty calculated pick as a DePIN leader for this cycle & the long term."

1,"SanDisk Develops HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) Killer: High-Bandwidth Flash (HBF) Allows 4 TB of VRAM for AI GPUs

Note, this new 4TB “VRAM” isn’t a new GPU from SanDisk—it’s a new memory technology that could be integrated into GPUs. 

SanDisk’s High-Bandwidth Flash (HBF) is designed to work much like HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) but with far greater capacity. In practice, a GPU manufacturer could incorporate HBF alongside traditional low‐latency DRAM (or HBM) on a GPU package. 

This would allow a single GPU to have a massive 4TB memory pool for AI inference tasks—where having huge, mostly read-only storage is more critical than ultra-low latency.

Unlike traditional HBM, HBF offers 8-16x more capacity at a similar cost, making it ideal for AI inference workloads that prioritize throughput over latency. 

→The architecture leverages stacked 3D NAND dies with parallel access to multiple flash arrays for high bandwidth., but does not match DRAM in per-bit latency. 

No release date or performance numbers have been disclosed.

→ Capacity scaling is significant—8 HBF stacks provide 4TB, meaning each stack holds 512GB of NAND, which is 21x more than HBM3E.

→ Challenges remain, including write endurance and latency, since NAND has finite lifespan and slower write speeds.

→ No official benchmarks or availability details yet, raising questions about real-world performance."

The two key pressure points for Nvidia's earnings are commentary on Blackwell demand and gross margin.

➔ More important than April quarter guidance is the commentary in the CFO letter regarding Blackwell demand for the year. Last quarter, Colette Kress stated that both Hopper and Blackwell systems face certain supply constraints, and demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for ""several quarters"" in fiscal 2026.

➔ ""Several"" likely means through the October quarter.

➔ A positive sign would be if revel that Blackwell is sold out for the year. However, if they continue using the “several quarters” language from last quarter, it would be viewed negatively.

➔ Regarding gross margin, they need to hit the 73% mark. If it falls below that, investors may worry about the margin bottom. The Street expects a 73% gross margin for both this year and next year."

0,"A TON OF THINGS HAPPENED IN THE STOCK MARKET TODAY.

Here's a full recap:

1. $NVDA Nvidia reports earnings tomorrow. May the heavens above us have mercy on our souls. 

2. U.S. consumer inflation expectations for the next 12 months rose from 5.2% to 6% in February, driven by persistent inflation and rising household staple prices. Factors such as higher egg prices and anticipated tariff impacts contributed to the increase. Meanwhile, consumer confidence dropped to 98.3, missing expectations of 102.5 and falling from January’s 104.1 reading. The decline suggests growing concerns about inflation and economic conditions. This weaker sentiment could signal potential headwinds for consumer spending in the coming months, highlighted by $WMT Walmart's guidance on their earnings earlier this week. Even with the consumer confidence news today, retail stocks like $HD Home Depot, $WMT Walmart, $LOW Lowes, and $COST Costco were green today. 

3. $TSLA Tesla's European sales plummeted 45% year-over-year in January, with only 9,945 vehicles sold despite a 37% surge in overall EV sales. The company experienced sharp declines in key markets, including Germany (-59%), France (-63%), and the Netherlands (-42%). In the UK, Tesla was outsold by China's BYD for the first time as its sales fell nearly 8% amid a booming EV market. Meanwhile, battery-electric vehicles now hold a 15% market share in Europe, indicating strong overall demand despite Tesla’s struggles. Tesla’s stock also dropped below $300 today, bringing its market cap under $1 trillion and erasing $600 billion in value over the past two months.

4. A short report by Bleeker Street Research on Rocket Lab USA $RKLB was published today leading to a 10% drop in the stock price. The report questions the company’s financial stability and timeline for the Neutron rocket, suggesting a potential launch delay of one to two years. It also raises concerns about Rocket Lab’s cash burn, estimating the Neutron program could cost up to $600 million, possibly requiring additional fundraising. However, Rocket Lab has a strong $1.05 billion backlog and expects $605 million in revenue for 2025, indicating solid demand for its services. The report’s timing is notable, coming just before Rocket Lab’s Q4 2024 earnings call on February 27, where the company may respond to these claims.

5. Robinhood $HOOD CEO Vlad Tenev told Bloomberg TV that he envisions the platform eventually expanding to allow users to buy and sell real estate. Vlad Tenev also praised the Trump administration’s stance on financial services and cryptocurrency, just a day after the SEC dropped its investigation into the company’s crypto business. Tenev expressed relief, saying, ""It’s nice to not have to play as much defense. I mean, frankly, in the last administration, we were playing a lot of defense."" He criticized previous regulatory policies, stating, ""There was an all-out assault on not just crypto but individual retail trading in general with market structure proposals, predictive data analytics, which is basically an assault on AI and financial services."" He highlighted the current administration’s support for innovation, adding, ""We’re fortunate to have, you know, an administration that wants the U.S. to be number one in AI and financial services and crypto."" 

6. MicroStrategy $MSTR has now retraced 50% from its recent highs, down 16% year-to-date, with its premium to NAV at just 1.5. Despite Bitcoin $BTC reaching $87K, MicroStrategy’s stock has struggled, reflecting weaker sentiment. Additionally, Bitcoin ETF inflows have been flat or negative over the past month, suggesting a slowdown in institutional demand. This combination of factors has contributed to MSTR’s sharp pullback, despite Bitcoin's continued strength. Investors are now watching whether ETF flows will recover and how that might impact MicroStrategy’s premium and stock performance. 

7. Piper Sandler raised its price target for Hims & Hers Health $HIMS from $24 to $35 but maintained a neutral rating, citing ""high future uncertainty."" The firm acknowledged strong growth and margin expansion but expressed concerns about subscriber retention, marketing costs, and competitive pressures. Analysts noted that while management expects a meaningful weight-loss contribution, clarity on future offerings remains limited. Short interest remains high, making it difficult to predict retail investor behavior. Other firms updated their targets as well: BTIG ($85, Buy), Citi ($27, Sell), Needham ($61, Buy), Canaccord ($68, Buy), and Morgan Stanley ($60, Neutral).

8. Following $GRAB Grab's strong Q4 2024 earnings, several firms adjusted their price targets. BofA raised its target from $5.10 to $5.80, Barclays from $5.50 to $6.50, and Citi from $5.90 to $6.25, while JPM set a new $5.60 Overweight target, and Benchmark maintained its $6 price. Evercore also maintained their $8 price target. Citi wrote: ""We view FY2025 revs and adj. EBITDA guidance prudent and in-line with management’s previous track record of guiding conservatively at beginning of the year. In 2025, mgmt. expects on-demand GMV momentum to sustain, which we believe is likely to be driven by MTU growth, higher transaction frequency and wallet spends through successful cross-sell and higher ad revs leveraging GenAI tools to enhance merchant sales conversion. We view upcoming entry/availability of autonomous vehicles as supplementary rather than cannibalistic.""

9. Super Micro Computer, Inc. $SMCI filed its long-awaited 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, meeting Nasdaq’s deadline to avoid delisting. The filing provides insights into the company’s financial performance, operations, and risk factors for the year. During their Q2 2025 earnings call on February 11, management expressed confidence in meeting the deadline and noted their new auditor, BDO, was working closely with them. They also reassured investors that no financial restatements were expected, as an internal investigation found no evidence of fraud or misconduct. Ernst & Young, SMCI’s former auditor, had resigned in October 2024 amid governance and accounting concerns. $SMCI was up 20% after hours.

10. President Trump signed an executive order initiating a national security investigation into copper imports, potentially leading to tariffs to boost U.S. production. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will oversee the probe under Section 232, the same authority used for steel and aluminum tariffs. Copper is considered vital for industries like EVs, semiconductors, and defense. Additionally, Trump announced a new program selling ""Trump Gold Cards"" for $5 million each to foreign investors seeking U.S. entry to create jobs. This initiative aims to attract wealthy entrepreneurs while bolstering economic growth.

11. The Fear & Greed Index hit 22, reaching extreme fear today. BofA strategist Michael Hartnett suggests the ""Trump put"" for the S&P 500 $SPX is likely around 5,600. He believes investors may anticipate fiscal intervention from a potential Trump administration if the index falls to the 5,600-5,700 range. Hartnett emphasizes that Trump closely watches the stock market, implying that significant declines could prompt policy responses. “The stock market is his traffic light,” he notes, hinting that market movements may influence economic decisions.

12. All-cash home purchases in the U.S. dropped by 60,469 in 2024, reaching 700,445—the lowest level in at least a decade. Over the past three years, the number of all-cash transactions has declined by 383,093 (35%), reflecting a broader slowdown in the housing market. Despite this, the share of all-cash purchases remained high at 33%, marking the second-highest percentage in the last ten years. At the same time, only 25 out of every 1,000 homes changed hands in 2024, the lowest turnover in over 30 years, compared to 40 per 1,000 in 2021, a record high.

The demand environment for Blackwell is extremely strong as evidenced from Capex raises by the large hyperscaler companies. In addition, we believe the supply situation has also improved past the initial ramp quarters of October and January. We continue to believe NVDA is sold out for CY2025 and we see increasing cadence of beats of magnitude as the year progresses.

Grok3’s rapid innovation is a lesson for frontier model developers: do you want to win fast or play with cost? Elon bet xAI on using Nvidia GPUs, while we kept hearing about Anthropic using Amazon chips and OpenAI developing their own."
1,"*NVIDIA EARNINGS WILL CREATE SELLOFF FOR SEMICONDUCTOR STOCKS, SAYS NORTHLAND $NVDA 

""We think NVDA's report Wednesday creates a selloff for semiconductors. We are confident in AI demand but a weak 1H due to capacity constraints. Big customers are shifting ASICs and limiting themselves to buying only GPUs from NVDA. 

In our view, a selloff would create a buying opportunity for companies with exposure to ASIC sales, including TER, AIP, and ALAB. Companies benefiting from AI at the edge, such as AIP and CEVA. Also, companies that alleviate capacity constraints such as CAMT. 

NVDA Headwinds: We believe a shortage of CoWoS capacity at TSMC limits the availability of server and data center GPUs. We think the shortage is partly due to changes in Blackwell's packaging. This constraint is expected to be relieved in 2H:25. NVDA still has Blackwell product transition issues. For this reason, we believe NVDA is pulling in GB300 and canceling orders for chips used in the GB200. Networking and connectivity content in servers will likely grow faster than AI GPU revenue in CY25. 

The hyperscalers are increasingly only buying GPUs from NVDA to build out the custom implementation of AI servers, and they are not purchasing the Grace CPU or Mellanox networking products. Hyperscalers prefer their NICs with proprietary security and other features they want to retain. 

We believe many customers are opting for AMD CPUs for next-generation AI servers, but again, capacity is also limited by CoWoS capacity. We see strong ramps of AI accelerator ASICs at Amazon and Microsoft. Google's TPUs purpose-built processor specifically for AI has been in production for 10 years. It is a mature architecture that is growing to support AI workloads. 

Based on our estimate of tester buy rate, we believe that internal hyperscale AI ASICs will increase from $20B in CY25 to $35B this year. We are optimistic about AMD's AI revenue and believe their AI GPU revenue will be $9.2B, up from $4.5B Y/Y versus the consensus that flat-down AMD's issue is not demand but a supply chain constraint in 1H. 

We estimate NVDA will lose 4% to 5% market share in the GPU/ AI accelerator market. We expect AI-related data center semiconductor revenue to grow by 45% in CY25. Consensus has NVDA data center revenue growing by 56.5% in FY26/CY25. Based on what we are hearing and our back-of-the-envelop calculations, NVDA should underperform AI-related data center growth by roughly 4.5%. 

AI Data center semiconductor chip sales will have anemic growth in 1H:25 due to the CoWoS capacity shortage. Companies consistently expect a 2H increase in AI spending; we think NVDA underperforms that recovery as market share shifts."""

As Nvidia shareholders, we can be sure even Jensen enjoys “buying the dips.”"
1,"Good morning, and God bless, #Team42!

Today’s Key Macro Question(s): Will #DOGE achieve significant deficit reduction?

No. But before we unpack why, we must quickly discuss NVIDIA’s $NVDA results. Fiscal Q4 sales beat by the smallest margin since Feb-23 and earnings beat by the smallest margin since Nov-22. CEO Jensen Huang guided to quarterly sales of ~$43bn—which beat analysts’ estimates, but also signaled lower gross margins due to the rollout of their new Blackwell chips. $NVDA stock is up +1% in the premarket today.

A lot of paper hands puked their #Bitcoin this week in anticipation of an $NVDA crash, among other things. Congrats to you if you weren’t one of them.

Back to #DOGE, we continue to believe that D.C. and Mar-a-Lago’s addiction to debt-financed growth will prevent @elonmusk from achieving his goal of significant deficit reduction. We took a lot of heat from poorly informed members of the Elon Musk fan club when we initially balked at the original $2tn dollar goal back in December with our friend @LukeGromen (replay: https://t.co/qrlVanZY0C). Emphasis on “poorly informed”. Some people don’t know what they don’t know and social media makes it easy as ever for them to prove how uninformed they are to the world.

We went on record saying @DOGE would likely find $500bn-$1tn in expenditure reductions, and that those cuts would be more than offset by: 1) the per annum double-digit growth of politically protected categories like Social Security, Medicare, and, now, Medicaid; 2) the $100bn-plus annual growth of net interest as Treasury debt matures and refinanced into a higher interest rate regime; and 3) the multi-trillion dollar cost of extending and expanding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) aka “Trump Tax Cuts”.

That was back in early December—well over a month before the DOGE effort officially commenced. What have we learned since?

1. @elonmusk confirmed Monday that DOGE has found $65bn of cost cuts thus far, which is well south of the ~$143bn currently being reported by https://t.co/Xv1WSQtpTW… like everything in politics, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle;
2. The House passed a budget resolution authorizing $2tn of spending cuts and $4.5 trillion of tax cuts, which result in an additional $2.5tn of fiscal deficits over the next 10yrs relative to the baseline of current law;
3. The Senate passed a much smaller budget that codifies their two-step approach to reconciliation: border and energy policy first, extending and expanding the Trump tax cuts second;
4. @realDonaldTrump posted yesterday morning, “I hope the House and Senate are able to agree on making the Tax cuts PERMANENT!”;
5. Understanding that this was the goal all along, the Senate is pursuing a budgetary accounting method called “current policy”, which magically reduces the cost of extending the TCJA—the main provisions of which expire on December 31—to $0, freeing up funds to expand the program to include President Trump’s campaign promises like “no tax on tips or overtime pay” and lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from the current 21%, among other things;
6. The House is currently pursuing a budgetary accounting method called “current law”—which correctly assumes the TCJA expires on December 31—to appease fiscal hawks that do not want this process to be treated like a blank check for more tax cuts that aren’t offset by expenditure reductions. Per Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a House Freedom Caucus member: “If you’re gonna do the policy baseline and make the TCJA permanent, if you’re gonna have more tax cuts but then you’re gonna presumably lower spending restraint, which is where some people are gonna wanna go, it just doesn’t add up.”
7. While the difference in budgetary accounting methods won’t make a difference to the amount of additional public debt in isolation, we can assume that if the Senate wins this debate, there will be incremental Treasury supply on top of the additional $2.5tn of public debt House Republicans voted for Tuesday evening.

We continue to believe the US is heading for a fiscal crisis by ~2030 due to a variety of factors, including:

1. Unserious efforts to eliminate deficits and stabilize debt growth (e.g., “we’re going to grow our way out of it”… HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, LOL);
2. A glaring unwillingness by Congress to present the American people with tough choices that require meaningful sacrifice;
3. The fact that risk-adjusted-return-seeking private sector investors—who are not dumb enough to fall for Congressional accounting gimmickry—now own 56% of the marketable Treasury market, up from 36% in late-2021;
4. The changing geopolitical landscape that may further reduce international demand for Treasury securities; and
5. The likelihood that the crisis phase of the current Fourth Turning catalyzes a complete mobilization of public sector resources and exponential growth in public sector debt to finance it.

All told, while the Treasury bond market may get temporarily bailed out by a deepening US growth scare, investors would be remiss to overstay their welcome. #Gold has experienced a largely uninterrupted bull run since fall 2023 due to the aforementioned reasons. Congrats to @42Macro clients for all the money they’ve made by staying on the right side of bullion market risk.

As one of the faces of the #AmericanDream across global Wall Street, I love my country and hope that our elected and unelected officials get this right. 

The #FourthTurning debt clock is ticking…

1,"A TON OF THINGS HAPPENED IN THE STOCK MARKET TODAY.

Here's a full recap:

1. $NVDA reports earnings on Wednesday. The street is looking for $38B in revenue and $0.85 of EPS. This will be one of the most important earnings for Nvidia and the broader market given stocks have fallen from their recent highs and some are questioning if the AI trade is intact, if capex spend will be enough for the semiconductor names this year and if macro conditions surrounding inflation and tariffs will allow the markets to stay elevated. $NVDA is now seen as a company that must be able to keep the broader AI trade relevant as investors become increasingly nervous about the current landscape for equities. Rosenblatt reiterated their buy rating with a $220 PT, writing: ""Nvidia reports F4Q25 earnings on Wednesday, February 26th, after market close. We expect a modest beat and raise for Nvidia's January quarter and March quarter outlook versus consensus estimates. All eyes will be on Blackwell commentary, where we see management reaffirming Blackwell shipments beginning in F4Q25 and demand continuing to exceed supply through FY26. We see shipments of Blackwell accelerating as we progress through the year, with a stronger F2H26.""

2. Tesla $TSLA is readying a software update for customers in China to offer driver-assistance capabilities similar to those marketed as Full Self-Driving in the US, according to Bloomberg. Over the weekend, $UBER CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed Tesla’s approach to the ride-hailing market, noting that Tesla prefers to operate independently in Austin, meaning $UBER will be competing directly with Tesla’s self-driving robotaxi ambitions. Tesla has long signaled plans to disrupt traditional ride-hailing with its own autonomous fleet, and its decision to go solo in Austin suggests a more aggressive push into the space, potentially challenging Uber’s market dominance in the future.

3. $PLTR Palantir is now down 29% from the its 2025 highs of $125 but is still up 15% YTD. Headlines around insider sales and pentagon budget cuts along with macro conditions changing are what some attribute to the decline. Palantir CEO Alex Karp also released his latest book, The Technological Republic and it reached number 4 on the Amazon bestsellers list. Loop Capital initiated coverage on the name last week with a street high $141 PT, writing: ""Palantir is well-positioned within the artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI (GenAI) sectors, which represent massive market opportunities poised to create several multi-billion-dollar revenue companies. Valuation is the primary concern, trading at nearly 44x EV/2027E revenue, which we recognize is steep. While we typically avoid recommending software companies at such high multiples, Palantir's potential as a market leader in AI software—with parallels to Adobe in digital marketing and Salesforce in cloud—makes it a compelling long-term opportunity.""

4. MicroStrategy $MSTR has acquired 20,356 BTC for $1.99 billion at an average price of ~$97,514 per bitcoin, achieving a 6.9% BTC yield YTD 2025. As of February 23, 2025, the company holds 499,096 BTC, purchased for ~$33.1 billion at an average price of ~$66,357 per bitcoin. $MSTR raised $2B at a 0% coupon last week and spent $1.99B of that raise in this acquisition of Bitcoin $BTC. 

5. $AAPL Apple announced a 4-year, $500 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing to expand supplier networks, Apple Intelligence infrastructure, and silicon engineering research across all 50 states. The plan also supports Apple TV+ productions in 20 states and reinforces its role as a major U.S. taxpayer, with $75 billion paid over the past five years. Apple, which sustains over 2.9 million American jobs, aims to boost domestic innovation. “We are bullish on the future of American innovation,” said CEO Tim Cook, highlighting plans to double the Advanced Manufacturing Fund and expand tech development in Texas.

6. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities is preparing to enter crypto trading, aiming to provide liquidity on major exchanges like Coinbase $COIN and Binance. After previously avoiding crypto due to regulatory concerns, the firm is now setting up market-making teams outside the U.S., with future expansion depending on regulations. While Citadel already backs EDX Markets, an institution-only crypto exchange launched in 2023, this move marks its first major step into broader crypto trading.

7. $GOOGL Google Cloud has secured a $2.5B, seven-year deal with $CRM Salesforce, enabling Salesforce customers to run key software like Agentforce AI and Data Cloud on Google Cloud. The partnership aims to challenge Microsoft’s dominance in enterprise AI and cloud, with clients like Wayfair and Accenture set to migrate Salesforce apps to Google Cloud. Additionally, Salesforce will integrate Google’s Gemini AI into its services.

8. $HIMS delivered a strong Q4 performance by surpassing revenue expectations with $481M compared to the anticipated $470M and meeting EPS guidance at $0.11. Additionally, the company showed FY24 revenue of $1.5B—an impressive 69% YoY increase—and grew its subscriber base by 45% to 2.2M. $HIMS guided for 2.3B of revenue in FY25, above expectations of $2B. $HIMS stock fell 18% after hours and is now up 71% YTD, down 42% from last week. 

9. $HOOD The SEC dropped their case against Robinhood regarding cryptocurrencies today. $HOOD is now down 20%+ since their Q4 earnings in which they surpassed $1B of quarterly revenue. Bernstein recently raised their PT from $51 to $105, writing: “HOOD is our best-idea for 2025. HOOD crushed Q4 earnings with its first $1Bn revenue quarter, led by 487% seq. QoQ growth in crypto revenues (733% YoY). Q4 was the election quarter and the big crypto inflection was expected. The market consensus here (which has scrambled post election to ramp up estimates) is still missing the business model shifts and the exponential revenue pool expansion. HOOD is building a global financial ecosystem across asset-classes - equities, crypto, tokenized securities, stablecoins, prediction markets. And leveraging blockchain rails to drive operating efficiency.""

10. Anthropic, the creator of the Claude chatbot with $AMZN and $GOOGL as their main early investors, has secured a $3.5 billion funding round at a $61.5 billion valuation, exceeding its initial $2 billion target due to strong investor demand. Backers include Lightspeed, General Catalyst, Bessemer, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. While still trailing OpenAI in user adoption, the company’s annualized revenue has grown to $1.2 billion, though it remains unprofitable. The new funds will support the development of more advanced AI models as competition intensifies, with challengers like China’s DeepSeek offering lower-cost alternatives.

11. U.S. equities now make up over 70% of the developed world’s market cap, a sharp increase from ~40% in 2008, while Europe’s share has dropped below 20%. Global equity investors are not only heavily concentrated in tech stocks but also increasingly tilted toward U.S. markets. The current decline in equities is consistent with historical trends for post election years during the latter half of Februrary: Seasonax's aggregated data shows that February marks a bottom in post-election years for equities, which could be interpreted as making sense because usually a new administration brings a ton of excitement that gets aggressive post inauguration in January and chills off by end of February.

12. Warren Buffett’s $BRK.B latest shareholder letter highlights Berkshire Hathaway’s growing cash reserves, now at $334 billion, up from $325 billion in Q3. In 2024, the company paid $26.8 billion in taxes, roughly 5% of all corporate taxes in the U.S. Addressing Berkshire’s large cash position, Buffett reaffirmed that most of the company’s capital remains in equities, despite a decline in marketable equities from $354 billion to $272 billion, while its non-quoted controlled businesses increased in value. Reflecting on 2024’s performance, Buffett noted that 53% of Berkshire’s 189 operating businesses saw earnings declines, yet overall results exceeded expectations, driven by rising Treasury Bill yields and increased holdings in short-term securities. Berkshire did not buyback any of their stock, noting that they didn't feel the price was attractive to buy it back at currently. He also signaled confidence in future earnings growth, suggesting a dividend is unlikely, recalling Berkshire’s only cash dividend payment in 1967, which he now considers ""a bad dream."" $BRK.B hit an all time high today.

1,"*NVIDIA EARNINGS WILL CREATE SELLOFF FOR SEMICONDUCTOR STOCKS, SAYS NORTHLAND $NVDA 

""We think NVDA's report Wednesday creates a selloff for semiconductors. We are confident in AI demand but a weak 1H due to capacity constraints. Big customers are shifting ASICs and limiting themselves to buying only GPUs from NVDA. 

In our view, a selloff would create a buying opportunity for companies with exposure to ASIC sales, including TER, AIP, and ALAB. Companies benefiting from AI at the edge, such as AIP and CEVA. Also, companies that alleviate capacity constraints such as CAMT. 

NVDA Headwinds: We believe a shortage of CoWoS capacity at TSMC limits the availability of server and data center GPUs. We think the shortage is partly due to changes in Blackwell's packaging. This constraint is expected to be relieved in 2H:25. NVDA still has Blackwell product transition issues. For this reason, we believe NVDA is pulling in GB300 and canceling orders for chips used in the GB200. Networking and connectivity content in servers will likely grow faster than AI GPU revenue in CY25. 

The hyperscalers are increasingly only buying GPUs from NVDA to build out the custom implementation of AI servers, and they are not purchasing the Grace CPU or Mellanox networking products. Hyperscalers prefer their NICs with proprietary security and other features they want to retain. 

We believe many customers are opting for AMD CPUs for next-generation AI servers, but again, capacity is also limited by CoWoS capacity. We see strong ramps of AI accelerator ASICs at Amazon and Microsoft. Google's TPUs purpose-built processor specifically for AI has been in production for 10 years. It is a mature architecture that is growing to support AI workloads. 

Based on our estimate of tester buy rate, we believe that internal hyperscale AI ASICs will increase from $20B in CY25 to $35B this year. We are optimistic about AMD's AI revenue and believe their AI GPU revenue will be $9.2B, up from $4.5B Y/Y versus the consensus that flat-down AMD's issue is not demand but a supply chain constraint in 1H. 

We estimate NVDA will lose 4% to 5% market share in the GPU/ AI accelerator market. We expect AI-related data center semiconductor revenue to grow by 45% in CY25. Consensus has NVDA data center revenue growing by 56.5% in FY26/CY25. Based on what we are hearing and our back-of-the-envelop calculations, NVDA should underperform AI-related data center growth by roughly 4.5%. 

AI Data center semiconductor chip sales will have anemic growth in 1H:25 due to the CoWoS capacity shortage. Companies consistently expect a 2H increase in AI spending; we think NVDA underperforms that recovery as market share shifts."""
1,"ROSENBLATT REITERATES BUY RATING ON $NVDA, PT $220

""Nvidia reports F4Q25 earnings on Wednesday, February 26th, after market close. We expect a modest beat and raise for Nvidia's January quarter and March quarter outlook versus consensus estimates. All eyes will be on Blackwell commentary, where we see management reaffirming Blackwell shipments beginning in F4Q25 and demand continuing to exceed supply through FY26. We see shipments of Blackwell accelerating as we progress through the year, with a stronger F2H26.

We continue to view the setup in CY25 positively for Nvidia, with a strong Blackwell ramp that is resilient to unit share losses to GPU and ASIC accelerator players. Nvidia's roadmap (which we expect an update at GTC in March) is one of increasing value that is highly complex with multiple configurations. We reiterate our Buy rating and $220 PT based on ~44x P/E multiple of our FY27 EPS.""

1,"$NVDA - NVIDIA SHARES REVERSE COURSE, LAST UP 1.2% PREMARKET"
1,The tight trading in Nvidia is more of a sign that no one knows how to value amazing earnings than it is that there is something wrong.
1,"After some concerns were raised by certain individuals regarding Singapore's revenue, NVIDIA added a disclaimer for the first time in its Q1 2024 10-Q filing. The disclaimer stated that Singapore is essentially a billing location, and the actual goods were shipped to other countries. Naturally, these concerns have continued to be raised by me and others, and eventually, the ""DeepSeek moment"" occurred, forcing the officials to investigate these revenues. Since then, everyone has been asking about the Singapore revenue.

As a result, PwC, in a stroke of ""brilliance"" with Nvidia, came up with a creative solution. In this 10-K, they decided to create their own definition for the SEC’s Regulation S-K and U.S. GAAP requirements regarding revenue associated with geographic areas. 

Instead of showing revenue from foreign customers or countries that constitute a significant part of their materials—like every other public company is required to do—they decided to fulfill this requirement by renaming the section from ""Revenue"" to ""Geographic Revenue Based Upon Customer Billing Location."" (!)

Now, how will investors know where the products are actually sold? How will investors understand which geographic locations are at risk due to regulations, wars, or other factors in different countries? 

Investors will now have to guess where these customer billing locations are actually tied to and where the products are being shipped. 

And if they can't guess correctly, don’t blame NVIDIA—it’s their fault for not knowing how to associate the customer billing location with the actual shipping destination.

It's just amazing."

1,"Inception Labs has launched the first production-ready Diffusion LLMs. Mercury Coder Mini achieves >1,000 output tokens/s on coding tasks while running on NVIDIA H100s - over 5x faster than competitive autoregressive LLMs on similar hardware

Inception’s Diffusion LLMs (“dLLMs”) use a new architecture compared to traditional autoregressive LLMs. This launch signifies a major step forward for LLM architectures and we expect it to accelerate research into this new paradigm. 
Previous research has demonstrated the potential of Diffusion LLMs but this is the first time we are seeing models released with production-ready performance and intelligence. Inception’s Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small are ready now for latency-sensitive coding use cases.

Architecture breakdown:
➤ Traditional autoregressive LLMs generate text one token at a time, while diffusion language models use a ""coarse-to-fine"" approach, refining the entire output through multiple denoising steps. This approach is similar to how most image and video models work.
➤ Critically, this allows parallelization of output token generation - allowing faster output speeds because many output tokens are generated at the same time. For autoregressive LLMs, GPUs can process input tokens in parallel but have to generate output tokens one-by-one - and are therefore face a memory bandwidth bottleneck on their maximum output speed.
➤ The Diffusion LLM generation process starts with noise and iteratively refines the output using a Transformer model that can modify multiple tokens in parallel.

Model details:
➤ Inception has launched two models under the name of ‘Mercury’: Mercury Coder Small and Mercury Coder Mini.
➤ These models are fast. For coding workloads, we have benchmarked Mercury Small and Mini as achieving 737 and 1,109 output tokens/s respectively. These speeds have historically been reserved for non-GPU architectures, such as on Groq, SambaNova and Cerebras.
➤ The models are focused on coding and are positioned well for latency-sensitive coding use cases. Mercury Coder Small and Mini achieve scores of 23 and 16 in the Artificial Analysis Coding Index (average across LiveCodeBench and SciCode), positioning them as competitive with Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite and GPT-4o mini.

Inception Labs background:
➤ This is the first release from Inception Labs. The founders were previously professors from Stanford, UCLA, and Cornell and have contributed to AI research & technologies including Flash Attention, Decision Transformers, and Direct Preference Optimization.

See below for further analysis and a link to try out the models yourself."
1,"A TON OF THINGS HAPPENED IN THE STOCK MARKET TODAY. 

Here's a full recap:

1. Nvidia $NVDA reported Q4 revenue of $39.3 billion, surpassing estimates of $38 billion, while Blackwell chip revenue hit $11 billion, far exceeding the expected $9 billion. EPS came in at $0.89, beating projections of $0.85. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted explosive demand for Blackwell, stating, ""Increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter."" Nvidia is guiding for a massive $43 billion in Q1 revenue, $1 billion above Wall Street’s expectations. For FY24, Nvidia posted $72 billion in profit, up 145% YoY, with a 55% net income margin and $7.8 billion in stock buybacks. CEO Jensen Huang also confirmed that Blackwell Ultra remains on track for a second-half 2025 launch, following the company’s annual release cycle. While the initial Blackwell rollout faced delays, it has now fully recovered. Unlike the Hopper-to-Blackwell transition, Blackwell Ultra will integrate seamlessly into existing architectures, reducing disruptions for customers. NVIDIA is already preparing partners for its next-gen architecture, Vera Rubin, which will follow Blackwell Ultra. $NVDA was down 2% after earnings.

2. $PLTR Palantir CEO Alex Karp’s latest book, The Technological Republic, has just been named the No. 1 bestseller by The New York Times. The book is sparking a debate on technology’s role in shaping Western values, as Karp’s message gains traction with the public. The Wall Street Journal described it as “a cri de coeur,” while the Financial Times called it “fascinating, if at times disturbing.” With its growing influence, The Technological Republic is driving conversations about the intersection of technology, ethics, and governance in the modern world.

3. A Florida appeals court ruled in favor of Tesla $TSLA, limiting the damages it may face in a wrongful death lawsuit over its Autopilot system. The 4th District Court of Appeal in Palm Beach overturned a 2023 decision, blocking the jury from awarding punitive damages and restricting Tesla’s liability to compensatory damages in the case filed by the estate of Jeremy Banner. Separately, Tesla’s Cybertruck won MotorTrend’s 2025 Best Tech award for its chassis technology, specifically its steer-by-wire system. MotorTrend praised Tesla for “fundamentally reimagining rack-and-pinion steering,” allowing the 6,900-pound stainless-steel truck to move with uncanny agility. These developments highlight both Tesla’s legal victories and its continued innovation in vehicle technology. Tesla $TSLA reached a new low for 2025 today at $287. 

4. $HOOD Robinhood officially closed its acquisition of TradePMR on February 26, 2025, for approximately $300 million, with 60% in cash and 40% in stock-based compensation. TradePMR manages around $43 billion in assets as of January 31, 2025. Robinhood expects the deal to be immediately accretive to Adjusted EBITDA. In 2025, Robinhood will record $85 million in related costs, including $45 million in operating expenses and $40 million in share-based compensation. These costs cover business operations, product development, professional fees, and purchase price amortization. $HOOD was up 8%. 

5. Elon Musk attended President Trump’s first cabinet meeting of his second term at the White House on February 26, 2025, despite not being an official cabinet member. Trump praised Musk’s work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), emphasizing his cost-cutting initiatives and efforts to reduce the federal deficit. Musk, wearing a ""Tech Support"" t-shirt and a MAGA cap, defended DOGE’s controversial policies, including requiring federal employees to submit performance reports or risk termination. While Musk’s presence sparked criticism due to his unelected status, the administration framed his role as essential in eliminating waste and inefficiency. The meeting also covered topics like a “gold card” visa for wealthy immigrants, foreign tariffs, and Ukraine negotiations, but Musk’s focus remained on streamlining government operations.

6. Snowflake $SNOW reported EPS of $0.30, beating estimates of $0.18, with revenue reaching $986.8M, surpassing the expected $957.09M and growing 27% YoY. Product revenue hit $943.3M, up 28% YoY, while the net revenue retention rate remained strong at 126%. Q1 FY26 guidance projects product revenue between $955M-$960M, reflecting 21-22% YoY growth, with an adjusted operating margin of 5%. Key metrics showed remaining performance obligations at $6.9B (+33% YoY) and 580 customers generating over $1M in trailing 12-month revenue (+27% YoY). CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy highlighted Snowflake's expanding AI capabilities, including a partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI models into Snowflake Cortex AI, reinforcing its leadership in data and AI innovation. $SNOW was up 9% after the earnings. 

7. Sales of new single-family homes fell 10.5% MoM to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 657,000, missing expectations of 680,000 and marking a three-month low. Persistently high mortgage rates and severe weather conditions, particularly in the South, weighed on demand. Regionally, sales declined in the South (-14.8%), Midwest (-16.7%), and Northeast (-20%), while the West was the only region to see growth (+7.7%). The median sales price stood at $446,300, with an average price of $510,000. Housing inventory reached 494,000 units, representing 9.0 months of supply at the current sales pace.

8. YouTube $GOOGL has surpassed 1 billion monthly podcast viewers, solidifying its dominance in video-first podcasting. Over the past year, users watched more than 400 million hours of podcast content on TV, reflecting its growing influence in the industry. While Spotify $SPOT is expanding its video podcast offerings to compete, YouTube maintains a strong lead with its ad revenue-sharing model and upcoming mid-roll ad updates launching on May 12. With seamless integration across video and audio formats, YouTube continues to outpace Spotify and Apple, reinforcing its position as the go-to platform for podcast consumption. $GOOGL hit a 2025 low today of $172. 

9. Salesforce $CRM reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $2.55, missing estimates of $2.61, while revenue reached $10.0B, slightly below the $10.05B estimate but up 8% YoY. Q1 revenue guidance of $9.71B-$9.76B fell short of the expected $9.91B, reflecting a 6%-7% YoY increase. For FY26, revenue guidance of $40.5B-$40.9B also missed expectations ($41.36B), though operating margin improved to 34% from 33%. Strong cash flow metrics stood out, with operating cash flow up 28% YoY to $13.1B and free cash flow up 31% YoY to $12.4B. CEO Marc Benioff highlighted record cash flow and a $60B+ RPO, while CFO Amy Weaver emphasized profitable growth and $21B returned to shareholders since the capital return program began. $CRM was down 5% after earnings. 

10. Amazon $AMZN has given Alexa its most significant upgrade since launch, integrating generative AI to enhance its capabilities. The revamped Alexa now supports real-time conversations, ticket booking, restaurant reservations, and smart texting, making interactions more seamless and intuitive. This upgrade is designed to bring Alexa closer to ChatGPT-level responsiveness, significantly improving user experience. CEO Andy Jassy stated that Alexa usage has jumped 20% YoY in 2024, emphasizing that Amazon is investing more in AI than any other company. With these advancements, Amazon aims to position Alexa as a more competitive and versatile AI assistant in the evolving smart assistant landscape.

11. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that the ""Epstein Files"" will be released tomorrow.

12. Today President Trump addressed questions about tariffs, stating that 25% tariffs will be announced ""very soon"" and claiming that the EU ""was formed to screw the U.S."" He confirmed that the tariffs would apply broadly, with a focus on car imports, and reiterated that tariffs on Mexico and Canada will begin on April 2nd, a day later than previously expected. The planned tariffs include 25% on Canada, Mexico, and the EU, 10% on China, and a potential 100% tariff on BRICS nations. Markets, which had hoped Trump’s deal with Canada and Mexico would last indefinitely, may now have to price in higher inflation expectations. Even with these announcements today, the $DXY was slightly up but still below $107 & the 10-yr treasury yield came down to 4.275%, significantly below the 4.8% yield from two months ago. While markets may have to price in higher inflation, spending cuts from DOGE and general weakness in the economy may be influencing bond holders to secure their yields by purchasing bonds which could be pushing yields down.
